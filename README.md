# Pine
A simple logging tool.
```
+ is good
- is bad
! is ugly
< is safe
> is attention
```

- files are divided into the good, the bad, and the ugly, for printing those 3 basic types of outputs
- there is an additional safe file, for printing everything else
- each run creates or appends to a log file everything that is passed to pine
